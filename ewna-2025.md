## Day 2

### ST Workshop
- **Workshop Details:** [Develop edge AI and WiFi streaming on STM32N6](https://resources.embeddedcomputing.com/Embedded-Computing-Design/stm32n6)
- <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  In this workshop, attendees will be introduced to the STM32N6, a high-performance STM32 MCU with AI acceleration, and then armed with the knowledge needed to leverage that technology for their specific Edge AI and multimedia applications. That’s done using ST’s STM32N6570-DK Discovery kit, which will be given to each attendee to keep. The kit is a complete demonstration and development platform for the Arm® Cortex® M55 core based STM32N657X0H3Q microcontroller.

    This version of the STM32N6 embeds the ST Neural-ART accelerator™, an in-house developed neural processing unit (NPU) engineered for power-efficient edge AI applications. This combination of devices enables real-time neural network inference for computer vision and audio applications.

    In addition, the STMicroelectronics experts will talk about the ST67W611M module which provides certified Wi-Fi® 6 and Bluetooth® LE connectivity, seamlessly integrating with STM32 MCUs or MPUs to enable wireless capabilities. Attendees will receive an overview of the video streaming solution using the ST67W611 in conjunction with the STM32N6. The integration of these two MCUs enables efficient edge AI processing with robust Wi-Fi® connectivity, creating seamless, low-latency video streaming from the edge device to the cloud.

    In this session, attendees will:
    Understand the core architecture and unique features of STM32N6
    Gain insights into how to start using the STM32N6 in your projects
    Learn how to deploy selected AI models using the Neural-ART accelerator
    Enable real-time neural network inference for computer vision

    Who should attend?
    This workshop is targeted at embedded engineers familiar with or looking towards implementing neural networks on microcontrollers with AI accelerators.

    Giveaway
    One STM32N6570-DK board + USB-C to USB-C cable will be provided to each attendee. The STM32N6570-DK Discovery kit is a complete demonstration and development platform for this new generation MCU enabling real time computer vision.

    HW/SW requirements
    Please bring a Windows laptop with USB-c connector or an adapter to connect a USB-c cable to their computer (data + power). Attendees should also have administrator rights, USB access rights and have completed the prerequisites (to be sent with your registration confirmation). The download and installation time of those prerequisites is significant and cannot be done in the time allotted at the workshop.

    Agenda
    STM32N6 overview (25 minutes)
    Getting started with the STM32N6 and exploring its basic AI possibilities (110 minutes)
    Break (15 minutes)
    Integrating the STM32N6 with the ST67 for connectivity (30 minutes)
    Brief overview of ST67W611 Wi-Fi 6 + Bluetooth LE module
    Demonstrate how the demo operates
    Hardware Overview of the ST67W611 and how to interface boards for video streaming
    Code Walkthrough: software architecture and code changes for Video streaming
